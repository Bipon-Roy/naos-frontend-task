# Music Search App

This is a simple web application that allows users to search for music and view relevant images using public APIs. The application is built using React.js with Vite for project scaffolding and Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a typical React application setup with additional configuration for Vite and Tailwind CSS:

-   **src**: This directory contains all the source code for the application.
    -   **services**: Contains service files for interacting with external APIs (e.g., Spotify API, Unsplash API).
    -   **App.js**: The main component that serves as the entry point for the application.
-   **public**: Contains static assets and the HTML file used as the template for the application.

## Components Used

-   **React.js**: The core framework used for building the user interface and managing application state.
-   **Vite**: A modern build tool that serves as an alternative to Create React App for project scaffolding and development.
-   **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for quickly styling the application components.

## Framework Used

-   **React.js**: React.js is used as the main JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It provides a component-based architecture, which makes it easier to develop and maintain complex web applications.
